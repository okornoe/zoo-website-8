            <p>Zoos play a major role in conservation and education.<br>
                95% of the wild population have been lost since the year 2000,<br>
                therefore the need for zoos in preserving these animals from going extinct.<br>
                It is known that the population some wild animals such as<br> elephants, giraffe, cheetahs etc
                are on the decline, therefore the need to preserve them.

            <h3>Feedback Form</h3>
            <p>Even though there is an outcry from some researchers and the public on the morality and ethics
                of keeping animals in zoos because of various reasons such as;
            <ul>
                <li>Zoos keep animals captive</li>
                <li>keeping some animals such elephants in zoos can alter their behaviour</li>
                <li>Zoos can cause health problems to the animals</li>
            </ul>
            Even though these concerns are legitimate and true there are some benefits of keeping animals in zoos
            such as;
            <ul>
                <li>Animals receive veterinary care from professionals</li>
                <li>Some animals are able to receive professional training</li>
                <li>Some of the animals are kept in zoos to protect them from poacher and hunters</li>
                <li>Because of zoos, some animals are conserved and prevented from going extinct</li>
