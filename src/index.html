            <p>Zoos play a major role in conservation and education.<br>
                95% of the wild population have been lost since the year 2000,<br>
                therefore the need for zoos in preserving these animals from going extinct.<br>
                It is known that the population some wild animals such as<br> elephants, giraffe, cheetahs etc
                are on the decline, therefore the need to preserve them.

            <p>People visit zoos and other natural habitats for various therapeutic reasons

            <ul>
                <li>Healing</li>

        <div class="testDiv">
            <h3>Benefits of Zoos to the Animals</h3>
            <p>Even though there is an outcry from some researchers and the public on the morality and ethics
                of keeping animals in zoos because of various reasons such as;
            <ul>
                <li>Zoos keep animals captive</li>
                <li>keeping some animals such elephants in zoos can alter their behaviour</li>

            Even though these concerns are legitimate and true there are some benefits of keeping animals in zoos
            such as;
            <ul>
                <li>Animals receive veterinary care from professionals</li>
                <li>Some animals are able to receive professional training</li>
                <li>Some of the animals are kept in zoos to protect them from poacher and hunters</li>
                <li>Because of zoos, some animals are conserved and prevented from going extinct</li>

                            Mole National Park is Ghana's largest wildlife refuge.
                            The park is located in the Savannah region of Ghana on savanna and riparian ecosystems at an
                            elevation of 150 m,
                            with a sharp escarpment forming the southern boundary of the park. The park's entrance is
                            reached through the nearby town of Larabanga.
                            The Lovi and Mole Rivers are ephemeral rivers flowing through the park, leaving behind only
                            drinking holes during the long dry season.
                            This area of Ghana receives over 1000 mm per year of rainfall. A long-term study has been
                            done on Mole National Park
                            to understand the impact of human hunters on the animals in the preserve.

                        Kyabobo National Park (pronounced CHAY-a-bobo) is a 360-square-kilometre (140 sq mi) national
                        park in Ghana.
                        Kyabobo is located in the Oti Region on the border with Togo. The nearest town is Nkwanta.
                        The reserve was established in 1993 but its boundaries were adjusted several
                        times until September 1999 when the current and final boundary was fixed.
                        Ghana's second highest mountain, Mount Dzebobo is contained within the park
                        and offers visitors an impressive view of the Lake Volta.

                        The Park's wildlife includes African bush elephants, African leopards, African buffalo,
                        waterbuck,
                        several primate species, bushbuck, duikers and, a symbol for the park, the rock hyrax.
                        A park survey lists at least 500 species of butterflies and 235 birds.

                        The park has seven hiking trails and two mountain biking trails.
                        The most popular hiking trail follows a ridge in the southeast corner of the
                        park to a peak atop one of the "Breast Mountains."
